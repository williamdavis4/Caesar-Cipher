# Caesar-Cipher
This repository contains a Python script for a basic cryptographic tool that implements the Caesar Cipher, an ancient encryption technique. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This tool provides a straightforward demonstration of the concept of encryption and decryption.

Features:

Encryption & Decryption: The tool can both encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher method.
Customizable Shift: Users can specify the number of positions each character in the text is shifted, allowing for different levels of simplicity or complexity.
Alphabet Preservation: The script maintains the case of the letters (upper or lower) and non-alphabetic characters remain unaffected.
Usage:
The script is executed from the command line and requires two inputs: the text to be encrypted/decrypted and the shift value. The mode (encryption or decryption) is determined by the function parameters.

Note:
This tool is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates the basic concept of the Caesar Cipher. It is not suitable for encrypting sensitive data, as the Caesar Cipher is a very basic form of encryption and can be easily broken with modern techniques.
