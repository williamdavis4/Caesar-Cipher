# Caesar-Cipher
This repository contains a Python script for a basic cryptographic tool that implements the Caesar Cipher, an ancient encryption technique. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This tool provides a straightforward demonstration of the concept of encryption and decryption.
